# Ryan's Pizzeria

#### A JavaScript Object-Oriented code review project for Epicodus, 01.29.2016

#### By **Ryan Brown**

## Description

Welcome to Ryan's Pizzeria!
This web page allows you to order pizza, and will reveal the price of your order depending on the size, amount of toppings, and the quantity of pizzas ordered.

It is also a way for me to show what I've learned using JavaScript and jQuery.  Specifically for this project, the focus is using JavaScript objects.
